        <p>The "AI Solutions for a Changing Climate" course offers a comprehensive exploration of how artificial
            intelligence (AI) technologies can be applied to enhance our understanding of atmospheric processes, weather
            prediction, climate modeling, and environmental monitoring. According to Climate.gov, Earth's temperature is
            rising at an alarming rate, averaging 0.14° Fahrenheit (0.08° Celsius) per decade since 1880 and
            accelerating to
            0.32° F (0.18° C) per decade since 1981,This course is designed for students interested in the intersection
            of
            AI and atmospheric science and aims to equip them with the knowledge and skills required to harness AI
            techniques for improved atmospheric analysis and prediction. </p>

        <p>The course is organized with a combination of weekly lectures and hands-on labs, providing students with the
            opportunity to acquire practical experience, cultivate skills and enable them to work on a meaningful
            project
            which will have a positive impact on society in the future.

        <h4>ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT</h4>
        <p>Committing academic misconduct, such as plagiarism and cheating, will trigger academic penalties including
            failing grades, suspension and possibly expulsion from the University. As a TMU student, you are responsible
            for familiarizing yourself with the <a href="google.com">Student Code of Academic Conduct.</a></p>

        <h4>ACADEMIC CONDUCT</h4>
        <p>The students are expected to pay attention to a lecture and volunteer to answer instructor's questions during
            the class-time. In the case of in-person classes, in order to create an environment conducive to learning
            and respectful of others rights, phones and pagers must be silenced during lectures, labs and evaluations.
            Students should refrain from disrupting the lectures and labs by arriving late and/or leaving before the
            lecture is finished.</p>

        <h4>Policy on Non-Academic Conduct</h4>
        <p>No disruption of instructional activities is allowed. In particular, taking video/photos in class is strictly
            prohibited since this violates the copyright and privacy policies. Do not send any private messages to other
            students. Do not distract your peers from learning in class with messages unrelated to lecture. If you know
            how to answer your instructor's a question, or you know what the next step in a solution should be, or you
            have a question related to the lecture, then Raise your Hand. Among many other infractions, the Code
            specifically refers to the following as a violation: ``Disruption of Learning and Teaching - Students shall
            not behave in disruptive ways that obstruct the learning and teaching environment." In particular, the
            students can use their electronic devices in class only for taking notes. In difficult cases, penalties can
            be imposed by the Student Conduct Officer.
